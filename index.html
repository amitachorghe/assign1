            <b>5 ways to improve mental health for software developers :</b>
            <br />

            health is something more fundamental, almost on the lowest level
            of<br />
            the hierarchy of needs, which includes mental health. Software<br />
            developers need their brains in good shape to do the work that
            they<br />
            do, and sometimes when things aren’t going well, we can see it in<br />
            our colleague’s code before the real problem is even communicated.

            The purpose of the header is to explain what your startup does
            and<br />
            why it matters. It needs to be easy to understand at a glance.
            One<br />

            their<br />
            header clever.<br />
            Zapier explains what their product does in three words:<br />
            “Connect your apps.” Then, they explain why it matters in <br />two
            words: “Automate workflows.” The implication is that <br />you’ll
            save a lot of time if you use Zapier.
